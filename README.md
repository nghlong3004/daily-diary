# Daily Diary

This repository is my personal daily diary.

## Each day, I record:
- What I learned (new knowledge)
- What I reviewed (old knowledge)
- What I built (project work)
- A daily summary that reflects my progress and plans

## The goal of this diary is simple:
- Track my growth as a deverloper
- Review what I learn over time
- Build consistency through daily practice
- Become a better version of myself, one day at a time

This is my space to document my journey - step by step, day by day
